== Installing with crwctl

This information is draft and subject to change.

To install Workspaces 2.0 with crwctl:

* Download the latest crwctl from https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl/releases and install it
* using link:custom-resource.yaml[custom-resource.yaml] in this folder, deploy Workspaces as follows:

```
# log in to OCP 4 (or Minishift or CRC)
oc login ${OPENSHIFT_API_URL} -u ${OPENSHIFT_USERNAME} -p ${OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD} ...

# run deployment using default CRW images
/path/to/crwctl server:start -n crw2defaults
```

Note: if using Minishift, you might have to pre-pull images if your Minishift can't properly authenticate with the registry.

```
# pull images from registry.redhat.io as minishift cannot use authentication secret correctly 
eval $(minishift docker-env)
docker pull registry.redhat.io/rhscl/postgresql-96-rhel7:1-47
docker pull registry.redhat.io/redhat-sso-7/sso73-openshift:1.0-13.1567588155
...
```

== Overriding default images when deploying

If you need to swap out a default image for a custom one, eg., for testing a change, you can do so in three ways.

=== Override operator and default images

```
# run deployment using custom-resource.yaml to override Che defaults with CRW defaults
/path/to/crwctl server:start -n crw2custom \
  --che-operator-image=quay.io/crw/operator-rhel8:latest \
  --che-operator-cr-yaml=custom-resource.yaml 
```

=== Override CRW containers in the plugin registry

Once installed via crwctl, you can override the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-plugin-registry/v3/plugins/eclipse[default CRW containers referenced in the plugin registry] as follows:

```
QP="quay.io/crw"
QS="rhel8:2.0"
for e in \
  THEIA_IMAGE=${QP}/theia \
  THEIA_ENDPOINT_RUNTIME_BINARY_IMAGE=${QP}/theia-endpoint \
  MACHINE_EXEC_IMAGE=${QP}/machineexec; do
    oc set env deployment/plugin-registry CHE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_${e}-${QS};
done

# verify it worked
oc get deployment plugin-registry -o=json | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env'
```
image:README.01_plugin-reg-overrides.png[oc get output]

=== Override CRW containers in a given devfile

Next, to launch a workspace using custom stack or plugin sidecar images, you need to override the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles[default CRW containers referenced in the devfiles registry]. 

Here are two examples:

* Java - link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles/00_java-eap-maven/devfile.yaml[original] - link:devfiles/00_java-eap-maven/devfile.yaml[modified]
* Node - link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces/tree/master/dependencies/che-devfile-registry/devfiles/03_web-nodejs-simple/devfile.yaml[original] - link:devfiles/03_web-nodejs-simple/devfile.yaml[modified]

Once you have your devfile, you can open it in CRW using your installation's factory URL. Open your CodeReady Workspaces installation, and in place of the `/dashboard/` part of the URL, append `/f?url=` then the full *raw* URL of your devfile to load it.

`https://codeready-${OPENSHIFT_PROJECT}.${OPENSHIFT_INSTANCE}/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-deprecated/master/operator-installer/devfiles/00_java-eap-maven/devfile.yaml`

Note: The factory page may not directly load your workspace. If that happens, just go back to your `/dashboard/` URL and you'll see your new workspace in the list of available ones. Click on it to start it up.

Once your workspace loads, you should see something like this. You can run the sample app from the `Terminal` menu.
