# Code Ready Workspaces Stack Image Dependencies

## What's Inside?

This module contains maven assemblies for collecting the language server dependencies needed to build the CodeReady Workspaces stacks images in the Red Hat Container Catalogue.

These are built in link:https://ci.codenvycorp.com/job/ls-dependencies-ci-master/[Codenvy Jenkins], then collected in link:http://orch.cloud.pnc.engineering.redhat.com/pnc-web/#/projects/153/build-configs/591[Project Newcastle] (NCL) so they're available to an OSBS Brew build.

If you're looking for the Dockerfiles that controls the OSBS container builds, go here:

* https://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/apbs/?q=codeready-workspaces
