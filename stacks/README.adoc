# Code Ready Workspaces Stack Images

## What's Inside?

This module contains Dockerfiles for the following stacks, which can be used to build these stacks locally:

* java
* nodejs

* dotnet
* php
* python
* golang
* cpp

NOTE: These are NOT the same as the Dockerfiles used to build containers for publication to the Red Hat Container Catalogue.

## How to Build and Push?

### Pre-reqs

#### OpenShift registry internal DNS

**IMPORTANT!** If you use a local OpenShift Origin or MiniShift installation you need to edit your `/etc/hosts`
to point IP of an Internal Docker registry to `docker-registry.default.svc`.

Get your local registry IP:

```
oc login -u system:admin
oc get svc docker-registry -n=default -o=jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'
```

And then in your /etc/hosts (replace IP with your actual IP)

```
172.30.1.1 docker-registry.default.svc
```

When on MiniShfit, run `minishift ssh` to get a shell into the VM.

You can skip this step if you run the script on the master node of OCP or OSD.

#### RHEL Subscription credentials

Since you will build images based on RHEL, you need to use own subscription creds. Run the following before executing `./build.sh`

```
export SUBSCRIPTION_USERNAME=myusername && export SUBSCRIPTION_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

### Build and Push Images

`./build.sh`

When on MiniShift, make sure you run:

```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```
