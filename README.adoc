# Code Ready Workspaces Operator Installer and Stack/Devfile/Lang Server Sidecar Dependencies Builder

This repo is for CodeReady Workspaces 1.x and 2, in support of non-operator based deployment (OCP 3.11). It also contains methods for building 3rd party dependencies needed by stack/devfile/lang server sidecar images.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

* `operator-installer/`  :: an installer script that launches the Operator with its configuration file; Maven module that packages both into a tar.gz

* `stacks/dependencies/` :: language servers and their dependencies packaged as tar.gzs, retrieved via Docker-based builds; these are then included in the stacks' container builds

* `pom.xml` :: maven pom to build all of the above artifacts locally

* `Jenkinsfile` :: script that builds all of the above artifacts in Jenkins

Note: This repo is called "deprecated" because while OpenShift v3.11 is still supported for now, support will eventually be sunset once everyone is using OpenShift v4. The process for collecting 3rd party deps may also change in future (eg., we might build more from source, or use a different process to collect them, like in
