# Code Ready Workspaces Operator Installer and Stack/Devfile/Lang Server Sidecar Dependencies Builder

This repo is for CodeReady Workspaces 1.x and 2, in support of non-operator based deployment (OCP 3.11). It also contains methods for building 3rd party dependencies needed by stack/devfile/lang server sidecar images.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

* `operator-installer/`  :: an installer script that launches the Operator with its configuration file; Maven module that packages both into a tar.gz

* `stacks/dependencies/` :: language servers and their dependencies packaged as tar.gzs, retrieved via Docker-based builds; these are then included in the stacks' container builds

* `pom.xml` :: maven pom to build all of the above artifacts locally

* `Jenkinsfile` :: script that builds all of the above artifacts in Jenkins

### Why codeready-workspaces-deprecated?

Originally the name was chosen based on some now-incorrect assumptions about future deployment process and how Che 7 would be built.

Note that the process for collecting 3rd party deps may also change in future (eg., we might build more from source, or use a different process to collect them). So it's still deprecated in that sense. 

Some examples of alternative ways to source 3rd party dependencies to include in CRW builds are below.
