# Code Ready Workspaces Operator - Installer and Stack Dependencies Builder

This repo is deprecated and will only be needed for CodeReady Workspaces 1.0.

After that we'll move to Theia and the OSD Operator Framework, so language servers will be installed on demand and the operator will be completely rewritten.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

* `operator-installer/`  :: an installer script that launches the Operator with its configuration file; Maven module that packages both into a tar.gz
* `stacks/dependencies/` :: language servers and their dependencies packaged as tar.gzs, retrieved via Docker-based builds; these are then included in the stacks' container builds

* `pom.xml` :: maven pom to build all of the above artifacts locally
* `Jenkinsfile` :: script that builds all of the above artifacts in Jenkins
