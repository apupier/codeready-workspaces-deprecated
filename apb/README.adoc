# Code Ready Workspaces APB

NOTE: Dockerfiles in this repo are NOT the ones used to build RHCC container images in OSBS.

To build stacks in OSBS, see http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/apbs/codeready-workspaces/tree/README.adoc?h=codeready-1.0-rhel-7

## How to Build Locally

```
docker build -t 172.30.1.1:5000/openshift/codeready-apb .
```

You can use any image name and tag. It depends on your OpenShift setup. For MiniShift and a local Origin,
you may use this image name (which is a default one for the installer script). For OCP, OSD, you need to build the image with whatever name, tag it and push it to your OpenShift local registry, openshift namespace (requires cluster admin privileges).

When on MiniShift, before building the image, make sure you local Docker is connected to MiniShift's docker daemon:

```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```

This way, the resulting image will be available from Docker in a MiniShift VM.

## How to run
